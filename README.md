## Run Code Locally

There are two ways to run code locally.

    1. After downloading codebase, unzip the file and go into the folder. From there, navigate into the **Build** folder and open the **index.html** file within a browser.

    2. Download the codebase and then unzip. In a command line, navigate to the head of the codebase directory, from there run **yarn**. Once all of the dependencies have completed download you can run **yarn build && yarn start** to run the page locally.
        **Note:** You must have React, Yarn, and Node.js on your computer before you can do this.

### Notes

There wasn't clear access to all of the typefaces used in the actual page so some fonts may not match completely.
